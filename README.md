# Rate-My-Class @ https://ratemyclass.tech
Stemmed from the fact that our current university (SUNY University at Buffalo) does not release course evaluation for students to view. As a student, it is important to be able to gauge the difficultly of a class and the obtain feedback from previous students of said class.

This project, created by Good Question in association with CSE312, will allow students to view and compose ratings and feedback for any class. This initial version will target the University at Buffalo due to the aforementioned issue.
