It is a fundamental phase, in which matters of biological and cultural evolution led eventually to the appearance of our species. This course explores the evidence for changing patterns of hominin behavior during this phase of our evolution. We will consider the major sites and material evidence that is used in current debates. We will evaluate the factors that might shape patterns in the distribution and form of Palaeolithic data. Critical thought will also be given to the use of behavioral models drawn from primatology (e.g. chimpanzee behavior) as well as anthropology (e.g. ethnographically recorded hunter-foragers) in the study of fossil hominin behavior. Questions will also be asked of the potential requirement for multidisciplinary engagement with associated fields, such as psychology.

Some of this information manifests itself in the form of cultural traditions; for example, artifacts spread over time and space or the languages we speak. Using a framework of social transmission theory, many anthropologists have increasingly turned to evolutionary theory and methodology to study cultural traditions in material artifacts, language, or other products of cultural transmission processes. This course enables students to explore the main theoretical and methodological aspects of using social transmission theory and cultural evolutionary principles to address human behavioral patterns. A large part of the class deals with evolutionary theory, and allows students to better understand evolutionary theory and its application. Case studies will be presented, which will highlight the broad range of data to which such approaches may be applied. We will consider a range of case studies from a diversity of chronological periods and geographic settings (including contemporary settings). You will also critically consider the concept of ?culture,? its presence (or otherwise) in animals other than humans, and what this may mean for the study of cultural phenomena. Students will come to see how contemporary applications of this approach differ from previous (and often theoretically erroneous) applications of evolutionary principles to the study of human behavior, which negatively taint evolutionary approaches to humanity to this day. The course will also help to dispel common misconceptions regarding the use of evolutionary theory to study culture, but be sensitively astute as to the reasons why these issues arise. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of both the theoretical and practical (methodological) tools involved in this type of work, and be able to conceive of how to apply them across various aspects of anthropological research.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

Evolutionary Medicine is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that uses evolutionary biology to answer questions about modern human health and disease. Instead of focusing on cellular or molecular mechanisms, this field seeks to understand the larger ultimate reasons why people get sick: Why has evolution left us so vulnerable to diseases such as obesity, heart disease, cancer, back pain, anxiety and depression? In this course you will investigate these questions by applying evolutionary theory and principles of human evolution to understand the causes of modern diseases, and how we can better prevent and/or treat them.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

The care of artifacts cannot stop at identification, physical conservation and exhibition. Research about museum and collection objects must be seen as part of a larger task: an exploration of the social and cultural significance of objects in relation to each other and to the people who made, used, and kept them as well as who collected them. Conservation must include preservation of the information accompanying an object, information beyond provenance, or artifact type. Finally, curatorial research entails a critical awareness of our own culturally-bound responses to artifacts. This course prepares students for research in the museum environment, and for the challenge of developing meaning and value for those collections in the context of the Cravens Collection housed since March 2010 in the Anderson Gallery of the UB College of Arts and Sciences where the course will be held. Each class integrates presentations, group work and discussion, case studies, and independent research. In addition, the instructor will facilitate visits from guest lecturers. At the end of the course, the students will curate together their own public exhibition of objects from the Cravens Collection and will write up short narratives about the objects they have studied during the course. The narratives will then be included in an exhibition catalogue.

Art has been said to be an imaginative activity drawing upon the right side of the brain, while science has been said to be analytical and situated in the left side. Alternately, the French poet Paul Valery has asserted Science and Art are crude names, in rough opposition. To be true they are inseparable. Art and Life charts the intertwined histories and mutual influence of the visual arts and the life sciences in the Western world. The premise of this course is that each discipline has provoked the other and made important contributions to the study and nature of Life, but that each and their perceived differences are products of an underlying worldview as evidenced by artifacts and scholarship of the time. In our current worldview, the course structure may seem unusual as it includes lecture, studio and laboratory components.

The goal is to familiarize students with the major social, cultural, political, intellectual and religious developments in the Korean peninsula up to the start of the nineteenth century, while at the same time placing these historical developments within the wider regional context of Korea?s relations with China and Japan. For most of East Asia\u2019s history, the people of Korea had more culturally extensive and historically significant contacts with its two neighbors than they had with each other. For this reason learning about Korea?s history provides a unique window onto premodern East Asia, and the history of these interconnections in turn reveals something important about the formation of a distinctive Korean identity. In addition to reading and being tested on primary and secondary sources on Korean history, students will be expected to demonstrate their ability to discuss and think critically about the material through written assignments.

        "description": "AS 374LEC - History of the Spread of Christianity in Asia This course traces the introduction and spread of Christianity in Asian history, focusing primarily on East Asia and giving special attention to Korea. It begins with an examination of Jesuit missions to Japan and China, as well as the role that India played in the establishment and maintenance of these missions. The different Jesuit strategies for accommodating or rejecting indigenous religious beliefs and customs are compared and considered, as well as the Nestorians in China much earlier. Then we turn to the unique way in which Catholicism was subsequently established in Korea, where Christianity has enjoyed unparalleled success in East Asia. We will look closely at how Christianity has affected and been affected by socio-political developments, its interactions with and influence upon traditional Asian religions, its relationship to nationalism since the late 19th century, and its tensions and conflict with colonialism and Communism in the 20th century. It concludes by asking what factors might have enabled Christianity to have such success in Korea (and the Philippines) and compare these to the situation in China and Japan.

Whether in search of gold or enlightenment, the India carried in the traveler\u2019s imagination often conflicts with the India that is actually encountered. This course is intended to serve not just as an introduction to the motivations and experiences of travelers to India, but also to the forms of knowledge that are produced in the wake of such travels. We will begin by examining the accounts of early Greek ambassadors and sailors and Chinese pilgrims seeking wealth and knowledge. Both Muslim and Christian adventurers produced travelogues that describe the marvels of India in the medieval period. The Mughal court fascinated Europeans sojourners, while Indian travelers were in turn both delighted and disgusted by what they observed in Europe. Hippies more recently and in their own way reenact quests by colonial British officials for the sublime and picturesque. The diversity of perspectives that these works present challenges readers to consider what it means to be an outsider looking in on a culture, compelling us to consider arguments for and against treating certain geographic and political regions and temporal periods as coherent cultural zones. By reading and discussing a wide range of both primary and secondary source materials, students will develop a broad familiarity with the history, literatures, religions, and geography of South Asia. All of the readings are in English and no background in South Asian languages, history, or literature is expected. This course is the same as ENG 388\u00a0, and course repeat rules will apply.

How do we make the best use of these potent matters that can benefit us and the society at large? These are some of the fundamental questions to the history of medicine, and driving ones for this course. Examining the history of poisons through twelve case studies, we will explore the complexity of poison materiality by contemplating the intimate relations between poisons, medicines, and foods. We will learn how the experiences of the body shaped the conceived values of poisons. We will examine the circulation of poison knowledge across social and geographical domains. Using specific poisons as the anchor of our analysis, we will explore the social fabric and cultural milieu in which particular ideas and practices of poisons emerged, flourished, or diminished. One key aspect of the course is to introduce a comparative perspective to the study of medical history. By studying above topics in both European/American and Asian contexts, we will identify surprising parallels, striking differences, and hidden connections between these traditions. Finally, we will ponder how knowledge of poisons in the past illuminates our notions and habits of ingesting and experiencing drugs today.

In recent years, biological sciences (and microbiology) have been transformed by the ever increasing complete genome sequences and entire microbial community sequences (metagenomes). Thus, current molecular biology research is being driven more by genome sequencing and functional analysis than by research of individual genes. Because much of genomics depends on comparative sequence analysis, an understanding of evolutionary processes is also essential. BIO 432/532 deals with the basic findings and approaches in the field of microbial genomics and metagenomics using bacteria and viruses as examples. We will cover conceptual aspects as well as methodology and technical advances that are central to obtaining and exploring genome sequences. Specific areas and topics that will be discussed include bacterial and viral genome structure and evolution, genomic variation, impact of horizontal gene transfer on genome evolution, and other issues in comparative genomics.

This course, thus, has three sections: understanding research, critiquing research, and presenting research. Through assignments in each section, students should gain confidence working with the primary literature that will allow them to better integrate their own novel research into a scientific context. In addition to gaining facility with reading and writing about primary research, students should become comfortable critiquing published work, as well as the efforts of themselves and their peers. Bio 487 aims to cover these goals through a mixture of lecture, in-class assignments, and peer-review of work. In a weekly guest lecture series (during class) students will have access to working scientists who will help them understand the breadth of new biological research being done here at UB, as well as the paths these scientists have taken to get to different points in their careers. In all, the course should help students immerse themselves fully in the world of laboratory research so that they come out ready to be confident members of a laboratory team.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: SpringRequisites: Pre-Reqs: GPA of 3.6 and acceptance by Director into the Honors program.

Fundamentally, a network consists of a collection of actors and the connections amongst them. Often the actors are individuals, but they can also be web pages, research articles, organizations, and nation states. Each of us is embedded in a multitude of networks, connected to others by cultures, social relationships, and communication technologies. Social Network Analysis is a collection of methods for analyzing these relational structures. The emphasis is not on the attributes of the actors, but rather on the pattern of their connections. Actors are defined not so much by their individual characteristics as they are by how they are related to others. Focused as it is on the nature of the connections rather than the nature of the actors, network analysis is a perspective that cuts across the social, behavioral, and natural sciences.

Second, it considers the unresolvable tension between popular sovereignty (\u201cwe\u201d) and individual rights (\u201cI\u201d). Third, it considers the limitation of democracy in its necessary calculus of citizenship, the dual question of both how to count and who counts. Fourth the course takes up the role of narrative (recounting and accounting, telling) in establishing citizenship and the tradition or legacy of democracy. The course focuses on detailed readings and discussions of founding and foundational documents of the United States\u2019 democratic experiment: declaration of independence, articles of confederation, constitution of the United States, debates on the constitution; writings of Jefferson, Douglass, Lincoln, Stanton and Anthony, Larsen, MLK, Morrison; and major supreme court decisions concerning citizenship, racial equality, reproductive rights, rights to privacy, same sex marriage. In sum, \u201cWe the people\u201d asks what it means to be a citizen and why democracy is at once the worst and the best form of government. In sum, in its consideration of the language of democracy\u2013of citizenship and rights\u2013\u201cWe the People\u201d asks what it means when African-American novelist Toni Morrison remarks, in Beloved, that the story of slavery and of a mother\u2019s desire to \u201cfree\u201d her daughter is \u201cnot\u201d one \u201cto pass on.\u201d What does it mean not \u201cto pass on\u201d the haunted narrative of our cultural and legal inheritance?

At the same time, we will keep in mind the unequal power hierarchies shaping our modern world, and therefore we will examine how and why certain forms have become delineated as \u201cWestern\u201d and others as world or \u201cethnic\u201d, despite similarities in movement, meaning, or purpose. The first part of the course introduces students to different methodological approaches to studying dance. The second part explores religious, social, artistic, and political dance practices. The final third of the course will look at dance as an expression of identity. Throughout the course, we will investigate issues of race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, tradition/innovation, authenticity/creativity, agency/resistance, borrowing/appropriation, and cultural hierarchies (low/high, vernacular/artistic, primitive/modern), among other topics.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

For example: Prof. D. Schmid, Intro Pop Culture Despite the fact that popular culture plays a large part in the vast majority of ordinary lives, its serious study is still a relatively recent phenomenon in the academy, which has tended to dismiss pop culture as nothing more than mindless, frivolous, even pernicious entertainment. This class will explore why pop culture matters by introducing students to the basic theories and approaches to the scholarly study of popular culture, concentrating in particular on how pop culture helps to create and reflect the zeitgeist of the periods in which it emerges and evolves. We will accomplish these goals by focusing on the theme of violence in American popular culture. From the Puritan period to the present day, Americans have always documented their intense interest in violence through popular culture and we will investigate the history of and reasons for this interest by studying examples taken from a wide variety of genres and subjects. Along the way, we will discuss the distinction between folk, mass, and popular culture; changing definitions of criminality and deviance; manifest destiny; urbanization; the influence of evolving media technologies, and the rise of a celebrity culture organized around criminals, with a primary emphasis on how popular culture gives us insights into the societies of which it is an integral part. This class will be taught in a large lecture format, with small seminar groups each Friday to discuss particular texts. For example: J. Bodway, The Gothic From the success of survival horror video games (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, etc.), to the continued popularity of horror films (Halloween, Saw, etc.), it is not a stretch to say that horror is a business, and its business is good. As a business, horror is an emotion that is manufactured by the images that we see and by the stories that we read. However, these images and stories have a history, and this course will examine how this history has come to shape our understanding. Our investigation will begin with a study of the gothic novel as it emerges at the end of the eighteenth century, then move into the many gothic themes of British and American Romanticism. Gothic literature often blurs the distinction between the physical and the psychological. In addition to our readings, we will examine paintings by such artists as Henry Fuseli, Francisco de Goya, and Gustave Dore. We will end the semester with a screening of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s rendition of The Shining; a tour de force of gothic cinema.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

Moreover, the theme of war gives us a way to study the relationship between literature and philosophy, literature and other arts (such as painting, photography, cinema, and music), and literature and technology. However, the definition of \u2018war\u2019 has changed dramatically over time and continues to change. Accordingly, this course will approach the study of literature and war by examining these changes, seeing how shifts in the structure of war can alter our experience of time and space, self and other, friend and enemy, nation and people, public and private, love and death, and war and peace, just to name a few.

We\u2019ll answer this question first by turning to the 18th century in Britain and France when the concept of culture (if not the term itself) came into being.

How do you distinguish between actions informed by religious belief and actions informed by habit? To what extent can you believe what you see is not clouded by your own beliefs and opinion? What are the criteria for comparing one culture to another?

For example: Prof. J. Frakes: The Middle Ages on Film When one thinks of medievalist films, Monty Pythons Holy Grail or Heath Ledger in A Knights Tale or Richard Gere in First Knight might come to mind. Interestingly, many if not most serious and important film directors have almost from the beginning of the art form made at least one major medievalist film: Lang, Bergman, Eisenstein, Bresson, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, Herzog, Greenaway, and of course Terry Gilliam. Spanning the history of film-making, these medievalist films more often than not provide insight into the filmmakers conception of history and of contemporary politics and social issues far more than of a particular attempt to `recreate the Middle Ages on film. A survey of medievalist film-making is a survey of twentieth-century political and social movements and in fact also a survey of the history of film-making. In this course we will conduct a comparative study of a broad range of medieval literature and film representations of the Middle Ages from Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, with a focus on the social function of the texts and films in their contemporary historical contexts. For example: Prof. A. Spiegel, American Genre Films Some of the most durable and popular stories ever told have been presented in a variety of American genre films. This semester the emphasis will be on Fantasy: Horror and Science Fiction, Musicals, Swashbucklers, Martial Arts, and some of the dreamier specimens of Film Noir; works like The Bride of Frankenstein, Blade Runner, Singin in the Rain, The Prisoner of Zenda, Blue Velvet, Enter the Dragon, and more. How much realism can be squirreled into an escapist format? We\u2019ll find out. For example: Prof. Joan Copjec: Post-War Image The flight from urban centers, which began after WWII in the U.S., was preceded by a new category of film set exclusively in claustrophobic but eerily empty urban spaces. These films which came to be known as noir or black films coincided not only with the collapse of the urban dream of sociality and technological perfection, but also with the collapse of the institution that manufactured and sold that dream to a delighted public: the Hollywood studio system. In Europe, too but first of all in Italy cinema took an unprecedented turn: toward neo-realism. In the first part of the course we will examine classic examples of film noir genre and neo-realism to see how they joined social problems and urban space to a new conception of the cinematic image. In the second part of the course we will examine the legacy of film noir and neo-realism in more recent films in which social problems are once again conceived as problems of urban coexistence and its failures to provide suitable modes of habitation for a diverse population. We will discuss the exponential rise of slums throughout the world and how IMF has gutted local economies while pretending to help struggling countries get back on their economic feet. The political struggles that have come to divide cities along racial and ethnic lines \u2013 in Paris, Jerusalem, and L.A., particularly \u2013 will be discussed alongside films that depict these divisions. We will attend to appreciation of the cinematic innovations and aesthetic breakthroughs which the films themselves invent in order to put these images on screen. Finally, we will discuss how the institutions of cinema, including international film festivals, play a role in defining these urban locations.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

A: Transnational Literature The study of literature from geographically and culturally diverse places that undermines the usual classification of literary texts in terms of national and regional literatures B: Literature in Translation Major texts in English translation, viewed in light of cultural and aesthetic cross-currents. C: Arab Literature Studies in literature by Arab writers in English translation, including focus on topics like Arab women writers, the Arab novel, and Palestinian literature. D: World Jewish Literature Study of Jewish writing, which has been written in all the languages Jews have spoken, including Yiddish, Ladino, Russian, German, Serbian, Hungarian, Polish, Hebrew, French, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. All literature taught in English translation. E: African Literature Studies in literature from Africa in English and English translation, including focus on topics like African women writers, the African novel, and African drama. For example: 383 A: Prof. C. Mardorossian, Transplantation, Displacement, and Identity This course focuses on narratives that emerged in response to a condition of exile, migrancy, and rootlessness that they paradoxically embrace and celebrate. The authors we will read emphasize the mixing of races, cultures, and languages across widely separate geographical and historical spaces. Throughout the semester, we will explore the alternative and regenerative forms of identity and self-understanding that are made possible by the experience of transplantation and displacement. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which writers depict their characters relation to their urban, rural, and physical environment. We will try and determine whether there is such a thing as a migrant aesthetics whose parameters we can identify in the fiction we read. We will read novels and short fiction by contemporary diaspora writers from India, Bangladesh, the Caribbean (Antigua, Cuba, Martinique), South Africa, England, and Iran. How do these works help us redefine the relationship between individuals and their environments? How do generational differences affect the literary production of these diaspora communities? What happens to diasporic literature when it is produced by writers who have not experienced their parents history of migration? What is the difference between diasporic, migrant, and exile literature? For example 383B: Prof. W. Hakala, Afghanistan in the Travelers Eye Afghanistan has long attracted the attention of people from afar. From ancient quests for the Water of [Eternal] Life to more recent expeditions seeking to exploit its vast underground mineral deposits, the Afghanistan carried in the travelers imagination often conflicts with the Afghanistan that is actually encountered. This course is intended to serve not just as an introduction to the motivations and experiences of travelers to Afghanistan, but also to the forms of knowledge that are produced in the wake of such travels. For example 383H: H. Young, Contemporary African Literature This class will introduce students to a wide array of contemporary African literature. We will examine the legacy of colonialism and slavery, reading about how Africans have navigated the forces of global capital that still wrack the continent today. Moving away from stereotypes of Africans as primitive, we will examine complex cultural, linguistic and political histories that engender literary portraits of sophisticated peoples dealing with the vicissitudes of daily living. We will read, amongst other things about ghosts, prophets, child soldiers and bees.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

This course is intended to serve not just as an introduction to the motivations and experiences of travelers to India, but also to the forms of knowledge that are produced in the wake of such travels. We will begin by examining the accounts of early Greek ambassadors and sailors and Chinese pilgrims seeking wealth and knowledge. Both Muslim and Christian adventurers produced travelogues that describe the marvels of India in the medieval period. The Mughal court fascinated Europeans sojourners, while Indian travelers were in turn both delighted and disgusted by what they observed in Europe. Hippies more recently and in their own way reenact quests by colonial British officials for the sublime and picturesque. The diversity of perspectives that these works present challenges readers to consider what it means to be an outsider looking in on a culture, compelling us to consider arguments for and against treating certain geographic and political regions and temporal periods as coherent cultural zones.

Conte: Postmodern Culture One of the cultural turns of postmodernism is the intensifying shift from a print to a media graphics dominated culture. The prevalence of visual media has been the site of a debate regarding the relationship of complicity and/or critique of art and architecture in postmodernism. In support of the happy embrace of popular media in art and literature, the landscape designer and writer Charles Jencks, in Critical Modernism: where is post-modernism going? (2007), revises his argument that postmodern art and architecture have led the way since the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis in 1972 in adopting an eclectic style that combines popular and elite forms, mixed media, and cross-cultural references. Fredric Jameson, however, offers a more skeptical and Marxist reading of postmodernism, described as the cultural logic of late capitalism, in which the contemporary arts are seen to have been at least partially compromised by their intimate relations with consumerism and multinational corporatism. Supplementing our reading of these and other cultural critics of postmodernism, we will be examining a variety of works of postmodern art and architecture that have become test cases of what appeals to both populist and museum-going audiences. These works are either playfully ironic appropriations of popular culture; or they are coopted by the commercial and celebrity media they represent; or both. Interleaved with the art and criticism, we will read books that, in the waning days of print literature, make art and popular media the subject of sophisticated literary fictions. For example: Prof. Ming Qian Ma: Modern and Contemporary North American Poetry Designed as a survey class of modern and contemporary poetry in America, English 400 will begin with a brief review of poetry written in the traditions of Realism and Naturalism and then proceed by following a chronological approach that cover the period from the so-called High Modernism to the present, focusing on the major poetic movements such as Imagism, the Objectivist movement, the Fugitive Movement, the Confessional School, the New York School, the Harlem Renaissance, the Beat Movement, the Deep Image School, the Black Mountain School, the Language Poetry Movement, the New Formalism, and others.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

In the mid-eighteenth century, women began for the first time to publish in significantly large numbers.

        "description": "ENG 470SEM - Special Topics The content of this course is variable. For example: Prof. J. Valente: Irish Literature Revival: The Irish Art of Scandal This class focuses on Irish novels from the 1980s to the present day as literary responses, in real time, to the slowly unfolding and deepening child abuse scandal, both disciplinary and sexual, in Ireland. We will look at how these novels represent the war on children conducted in Irelands Catholic orphanages, Magdalen laundries, industrial schools and church sacristies. That is to say, we will interpret the novels as modes of social intervention in a problem involving both violence and secrecy. But we will also seek to determine what is distinctively literary in these interventions, what difference it makes that these are in fact fictional narratives with aspirations to aesthetic value. In a larger sense we will be pondering the social vocation of literary art, the specific means and consequences of literatures reaction to social and moral crises. For example: Rhonda Reid: Tutoring/Teaching Composing/Writing Do you want to teach Tutor in the Writing Center Learn about writing in the professions and the workplace Improve your writing English 470 introduces students to theories of writing and focuses on improving writing through one-on-one conferencing. Students who have completed the course are eligible to apply as peer tutors in the Center for Writing Excellence. The course should: introduce composition theories and learning theories; improve writing abilities through reading, practice, conferences, and reflection; help develop oral communication for effective one-on-one interaction as well as group discussion and presentations; develop tutoring skills and strategies to work with writers from diverse backgrounds, including other disciplines; expand knowledge of ways to use technology to communicate effectively; enhance research strategies and skills; and develop leadership abilities.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

One of the hallmarks of successful management in a complex and rapidly changing environment is the ability to recognize decision situations, understand their essential features, and obtain insight that makes clear what the appropriate actions are. Some successful managers seem to have an innate ability to do this. Many consider decision making as an art; something learned by trial and error; something based on creativity, judgment, intuition, and experience rather than anything based on a set of systematic methods. This course will give you a structured way of attacking a wide range of real problems, using data-driven analysis to guide decision-making. We will consider how you can think about and manage uncertainty and risk, how to translate data about the business into useful insights, how to put value on various courses of action, and how to generally make informed decisions. Fundamental to decision making is a model that represents the situation. The spreadsheet-modeling environment is a most widely accepted modeling tool for managerial decision making. This course studies two fundamental issues of decision making, namely, the modeling of situations or problems and the solution of those problems. The purpose of this class is to provide you with a working knowledge of a method to address decision situations in a rational, well-organized manner. Decision analyses using simple yet effective quantitative tools will be explored. The use of computer decision support for these analyses will be emphasized.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: SpringRequisites: Pre-Requisite: MGQ 301\u00a0, and MGS 351\u00a0\u00a0with minimum grades of B.

The main objective is to learn about how gender ideologies impact scientific research and practices around women\u2019s bodies, shaping women\u2019s abilities to learn about their bodies and their access to healthcare. This class is explicitly designed to both ground students in the best practices of scientific inquiry and to draw from work in the humanities and social sciences to understand how science is shaped by broader social beliefs and practices. Students will be able to use this perspective in discussions and activities that explore the role of gender, race, class, religion, and sexuality in shaping the study of women\u2019s bodies and health. The class will cover topics such as: women\u2019s health and disease, the anatomy of the female body; pregnancy and maternal health; and the need for a focus on the diversity of women\u2019s bodies and access to healthcare.

This class will explore these questions and more. While we tend to think of men/women and homosexuality/heterosexuality as opposites, the reality is far more nuanced: a spectrum of genders and sexualities, rather than two opposing poles, which reflects a variety of cultural and historically specific meanings. This course will introduce students to a survey of those meanings (and the labels we attach to them), and to the social, cultural, religious, and legal practices that affect how they are created, understood, and policed. Beginning with the historical emergence of sexuality, we will examine the creation of the hetero/homo binary and the associated hierarchization based on sexual identity that results from the creation of these categories. We will examine the history and practices of the gay and lesbian liberation movements, the push for equality, and the impact of the AIDS crisis. Finally, students will apply the vocabulary and critical skills they have learned to an analysis of the expressions of sexuality in popular culture including literature, music, television and film.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

A solid grasp of the core theories, their fundamental approaches, their insights into social phenomenon and the key criticisms of each, will allow the student to enter into and participate in the ongoing conversations that characterizes feminist thought. Feminist theory has always developed in tandem with feminist movements and activism. Thus, throughout the course, students will not only learn about feminist theories, but also apply the tenets of different theories to current issues and modern problems. Theories are not meant to be passive ideas unrelated to our everyday reality, but are meant to be used as tools to analyze the world around us. As a critical theory, feminist theory aims not only to produce knowledge, but also to provide a base for action. Feminist theories ask us to rethink what we mean by sex and gender, how we understand our sexuality, the roles, status, and ideals assigned to men and women in our societies and how we reward and punish individuals that question, challenge or deviate from these roles. Feminist theory engages with issues of social inequality, oppression, and sexism, and invites us to imagine strategies for creating a world where there is more equality and liberation.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

Explores how women in Latin America and the Caribbean have participated in the national movements, revolutions, rebellions, and social movements that have dominated Latin America\u2019s political, social, and economic development. Readings cover the incredible variety of women\u2019s participation by examining women\u2019s activism across time, space and political position. Women\u2019s struggles to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of others are a central component of the course. However, to avoid romanticizing women\u2019s activism, the course also discusses women\u2019s actions on behalf of political projects designed to uphold the interests of the elite and the status quo. Women in Latin America and the Caribbean, as elsewhere, live complicated lives, have complicated political goals and commitments, and have different access to political, social, and economic power depending upon their position within the class, racial, ethnic, religious, age, and gender hierarchies of their societies. Over the semester, we will analyze why women have been involved in political movements, the effects of women\u2019s activism on women\u2019s position within these societies, the changing relationship between men and women, contested understandings of gender relations, and the overall impact of these struggles on the Latin American and Caribbean countries.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

Recently, the analysis has shifted to understanding empire as a cultural phenomenon-to understanding it, that is, as a system of thought that enabled the political and economic view of colonialism. Recent analysis also stresses that colonialism had cultural repercussions both for the colonial authorities and for the colonized. This course applies these insights as it explores three phases of European imperialism. We begin by looking at the Spanish empire in the New World and at the expansion of trade and the gradual accumulation of outposts in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The emphasis then shifts to the study of nineteenth-century colonialism. The first example will be India: how the British came to control and administer this part of the world. Then, we shall examine the transfer of this model of colonial administration to Africa in the late nineteenth-century, examining, at that point, French, German, as well as British versions of empire.

But how did marijuana get to be illegal in the first place? Who decided that some drugs are so dangerous we should fight a war against them, while others are so beneficial that entire industries should be devoted to encouraging their use? Why are American debates over drugs so intense and so complex, and why have they produced such a contradictory legal and cultural landscape? This course answers such questions by exploring the rich history of alcohol and other drugs in America: from the Pilgrims, beer riots to Prohibition, from cocainized Coca-Cola to \u201ccrack: cocaine, from Bayer\u2019s Heroin to Purdue Pharmas OxyContin, from the Marlboro Man to vape lounges, from vipers to hippies to ravers.

We question to what extent sexuality is natural/biological or cultural/social. To understand sexuality as having a history, we will investigate three areas within American society: First, we will look at views of sexuality within major belief systems like religion, science, and the law. Second, we will trace changing sexual beliefs and practices in everyday life, examining sex as an ordinary part of family and community life. Finally, we will look at sexuality when it becomes an explicit part of American political life, as it did in the 19th-century temperance movement, the early 20th century birth control movement, the post-Stonewall (1969) gay and lesbian movement, and today\u2019s anti-abortion movement.USHCredits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Fall, Spring"

Thus, clothing has come to be a vital element in the constitution of a vast number of social hierarchies including gender, race, sexuality, ethnic and nationality, and class. The now established field of fashion studies also engages the business of fashion, which encompasses trade, production, shopping, consumerism, advertising, social media, and celebrity culture. This course will investigate clothes both as artistic creations and as consumer products and will pay particular attention to the interplay between the two. In sum, \u201cMaking Fashion: Art, Ethics, and Practice\u201d will engage students in thinking critically about art, cultural production, history, and the rise of consumer capitalism through clothing and the practices of dressing in which students and indeed all individuals participate. While the history of fashion has long been focused primarily on the West since the Renaissance, this class will endeavor to place so-called \u201cbirth of fashion\u201d in Europe into its global context by comparing and contrasting the art and practice of fashion around the globe and in an extended chronology.

Soldiers living in close quarters and poor conditions suffer from dysentery, trench foot, and malaria. And of course, the central aim of warfare is to inflict bodily injury. Since ancient times, wars have created public health problems, ranging from the Plague of Athens to the spread of sexually transmitted infections during the World Wars and Vietnam. Soldiers have been used as test subjects, helping to shape ideas about ideal intelligence and body types. As military technology advances, so does the damage that new weapons create, evidenced by the devastating wounds inflicted by mini balls and improvised explosive devices. This course explores the many ways that health, disability, and war have intersected across history. From the Peloponnesian War, to the Hundred Years War, to Operation Iraqi Freedom, we will discuss topics including physical and mental war wounds, sexuality, public health, the rise of military medical authority, eugenics, and chemical and biological weapons.

This simple question invites us to ponder myriad ways that food connects to our lives, from cooking to eating, from spice to medicine, from the expression of the self to the mediation of social relationship. Not surprisingly, food constitutes a vital aspect of Asian culture that figures saliently both in Asia and beyond. Even without going to Asian, we may all have the experience of tasting sushi, General-Tso?s chicken, or curry.

Topics covered in this course include the techniques of cooking (we may try ourselves), the religious meanings of food, regional features, food trade, food and colonialism, food and national identity, and Asian food in America.

The goal is to familiarize students with the major social, cultural, political, intellectual and religious developments in the Korean peninsula up to the start of the nineteenth century, while at the same time placing these historical developments within the wider regional context of Korea?s relations with China and Japan. For most of East Asia\u2019s history, the people of Korea had more culturally extensive and historically significant contacts with its two neighbors than they had with each other.

And you?re not alone: most Americans regularly use at least some drugs, whether it be beer, coffee, cigarettes, Adderall, NyQuil, marijuana, OxyContin, heroin, or something else. Drug taking is something most Americans share. USH Yet what we share also divides us. Some drug markets are legal and well-advertised, others are illegal and clandestine. Some drug use saves lives, other use kills. Where a person?s drug use falls on this spectrum?whether it harms or helps, brings praise or condemnation, raises stock prices or fills prisons?does not depend on the pharmacological characteristics of the drugs involved. Instead it is determined by social contexts of manufacture, commerce, and consumption. These context, in turn, are shaped by culture and politics: by our understanding of disease and the configuration of our medical system; by our understanding of morality and the configuration of our criminal justice system; by our understanding of self-fulfillment and the configuration of our consumer culture; and by our understanding of race, class, and gender and the configuration of our social hierarchies.

Although this is not a history course, Six Nations historical experiences and the continuity of Haudenosaunee knowledge, traditionalism and governance will play a key role in the presentation of materials involving contemporary issues. We will examine non-Indigenous representations of Iroquois history and traditions and consider some of the political implications arising from these texts. We will attend to the various ways in which Haudenosaunee scholars, along with others, have questioned and recast the analytic assumptions that have long prevailed in the 200-year expanse of academic literature on the Iroquois. Ongoing challenges on Haudenosaunee territories across the Confederacy will also be discussed with reference to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous experiences and worldviews. We will also historically situate and clarify Haudenosaunee assertions that are often misconstrued as recent, with respect to nationalism, sovereignty, land rights, and the overall relationship between the Six Nations and North American settler states.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Fall, Spring"

Hence he radically challenged the traditional Western privileging of ?the true? over ?the good,? science over ethics. Instead of basing ethics in ?rules? or ?norms,? whether natural or religious, for Levinas the ethical begins in the imperative responsibility one person has for another (morality), to alleviate the other?s suffering, and building on this in the responsibility each person has for everyone else (justice.) The aim of this course is first to explicate Levinas?s thought. It will also highlight its differences from other relevant thinkers, ancient, modern and contemporary.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: SpringRequisites: Pre-Requisite: Seniors Only"

Are the dire predictions of a human-inflicted apocalypse something we need to worry about, or are they exaggerated? And what does the end of nature even mean for humans, non-humans, and our environments? Proclaiming that the natural world is disappearing is nothing new. As far back as Plato, people have complained about humans altering nature beyond repair. Is there anything that sets the period we are living through, newly referred to as the Anthropocene, apart from those earlier times? And does this situation really change everything, as Naomi Klein argues in her book about climate change? Finally, how do our scientific and legal systems account for this change? These questions are particularly acute in light of the assaults by the current political administration in the United States on the EPA, national parks, and efforts to mitigate climate change. This interdisciplinary course will draw on legal, scientific, and cultural perspectives to discuss climate change, species extinction, biodiversity loss, capitalism, and the Anthropocene.

Above all, jazz\u2019s diversity is tied to similarly diverse communities, where it often reflected and inspired the complex realities of Black men and women\u2019s search for equality and power. The blues, for example, are studied as a musical convention originating in 1920s popular music, where its frank expressions of sexuality represented a new reality for the community of Black men and women that lived in the first generation after the abolition of slavery. Swing in the 1930s and 40s was, by contrast, a form of music that reached into spaces of economic and geographic mobility for Black musicians like Fletcher Henderson. Enhancing the focus on the individuals that shaped jazz, students will read essays by the musicians themselves, clearly positioning jazz as an extension of Black music making and community.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

We will examine the ways in which music has represented, reinforced, questioned, challenged, and/or dismantled gender identity in repertoire ranging from twelfth-century Christian mysticism to Hip Hop at the end of the twentieth century. Specifically, the first half of the semester explores how art music of the convent, the court, the opera stage, or the concert hall has shaped and given voice to historical and political configurations of gender and sexuality and how those representations have carried over into popular music. The second half of the semester examines in more detail styles and genres of popular music that have been instrumental in addressing issues of gender and sexuality in relation to questions of race and class.

Each weekly course module is structured around three guiding questions about music, the first of which is \u201cWhen do we hear it?\u201d After investigating the cultural circumstances in which the music was created, we then ask \u201cWhat does it sound like?\u201d through a participatory introduc-tion to the stylistic elements (such as melody and rhythm) from which all music is made. The ability to analyze almost any style of music according to these principles ultimately helps us to unravel the question of \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d as our discussion turns to the mysteries of musical communication. You do not need any prior musical training as a performer in order to approach the topics above as a thoughtful listener. We will consider musical case studies drawn from a broad range of historical and geographical milieux in order to understand why music remains one of the most sublime and powerful expressions of human culture throughout the world.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Fall, Spring"

Important topics of discussion will include the origins of Western musical notation, the development of polyphony, the shift from modal to tonal theories of harmony, and the invention of opera. Throughout the semester, we shall focus on understanding how even the largest of these developments came about through the decisions of individual musicians and their patrons in response to an ever-changing mosaic of historical circumstances. The broader aims of the course are to encourage music majors and minors to start developing a breadth of understanding as to the multiple ways in which understanding music in an historical time frame might be important. We will also use the historical case studies as a means of investigating issues that have a trans-historical valence, such as: the role of music in ritual practice; the aesthetics of difficulty in music; questions of expression; the variety of means by which text and music might interact; problems posed to understanding by music.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: FallRequisites: Pre-Requisite: MUS 105\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0MUS 105\u00a0\u00a0Or MUS 106\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0MUS 106\u00a0\u00a0."

We will be seeking to use the skills acquired in Part I of the Survey into the investigation of Western music from the middle of the eighteenth-century through to the early 1960s. The course will develop students\u2019 abilities to apply historical, critical, and political concepts to the specific analytic details of both musical scores and musical sound. And thus, on the pragmatic level, the course will aim to develop students? skills at reading musical scores analytically, listening to music within an historically informed framework, being able broadly to recognize the different stylistic periods, and (by means of the examinations) to develop a basic toolbox of important musical terms and to develop a memory and repertoire of different musics (through score identification). We will also continue developing the practice of reading scholarly texts, already begun in MUS 213, with the four substantial readings that have been assigned for the course of the semester. Whilst the reportorial focus of our investigations will be the works of the Western art music cannon, the larger (and more important) aims of the course will, nevertheless, be to understand that the conflicts, difficulties, and uncertainties that we face today as humans in an increasingly vexed global context are part of a long-term and ongoing debate about what the human is, what its rights should be, and how its creative, artistic and musical endeavors should relate to the social and political structures that come into being as a result. This ongoing discourse we can call, for want of a better term, modernity, and its roots lie, to a large degree, in the philosophical ideas and political and social practices that started to come into being at the point at which Part II of the survey begins: in other words, the beginning of the eighteenth century.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

In part, this will lead us to a relatively conventional exploration, predominantly in the first half of the semester, of how different Western composers have taken up the Orpheus theme and molded it to the requirements of their particular historical contexts. In the second half of semester, however, we will branch out into how the myth has acted as an instigation for broader global issues, particularly concerning race, expression, and the legacies of colonialism. As a result, the course is as much about how questions that have arisen in relationship to music can spread out into other fields, as it is purely about Orpheus and music per se. This intention to broaden out is exemplified, particularly in the second part of semester by the fact that our investigations will become more unapologetically interdisciplinary,Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Requisites: Prerequisite:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MUS 213\u00a0\u00a0or MUS 214\u00a0\u00a0"

The first worldviews that evolve into philosophical worldviews are the early religions of the world, beginning with the animistic outlook of hunter-gatherers in which human beings understand themselves in a spiritual/emotional connection with the surrounding natural world. The major philosophies of India and China, the philosophies of the East, provide philosophical reflective meanings that are continuous with this animistic background, while the philosophies of the West, beginning with Greek philosophy, break from such animistic unity with the surrounding world. After providing this general framework, the course first examines the major philosophical concepts of India, China, and Greece in the context of distinctive characteristics of these three civilizations, so as to show the connection between their philosophical orientations and these historically specific characteristics. The course then examines the development of philosophy in Western Europe in the context of the rise of modern science?as both a development and transformation of ancient Greek philosophy under the impulse of the new sciences. The resulting ?Enlightenment? philosophies of the early modern Western period of the 17th and 18th century is then criticized by Kant and 19th century Continental philosophers, resulting in historically relative concepts of reason (Hegel and Marx) as well as anti-rational philosophies appealing to religion (Kierkegaard) or power (Nietzsche). The course then returns to later developments in India, China and elsewhere in response to Western imperialism. The course concludes with an examination of 20th century Western philosophy as a continuation of the conflict between the empirical/analytical orientation of early modern philosophy prominent in Great Britain and the United States and the critical, synthetic philosophies of Continental Europe.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)"

The best tools we have for thinking through these problems are models. Models allow us to extract a simpler version of our problem from the messiness of the real world, and then test out our ideas to find the best solution. In this course, we will learn about a variety of models that the social sciences use to think about the world, and then examine the philosophical challenges of using models to guide our reasoning. We will learn about when models might help us, and when models might mislead us, and what we can do about it.

Seeking these breakthroughs at their sources, we will explore the old and the new in the prose and poetry of Kant, Mendelsohn, Hegel, Feuerbach, Schopenhauer, Marx, Melville, Dostoyevsky, Whitman, Comte, Darwin, Bergson, Nietzsche and Freud, among others.

There are many ways in which this statement rings true, as the difficult task of aggregating the preferences of the electorate is made workable when voters are presented with a limited number of choices at the polls. For their part, though, the American electorate has often expressed a deep-seated ambivalence about political parties, and a number of major reform movements throughout American history have been geared toward lessening their impact on the political process. Yet the parties have exhibited a remarkable ability to survive and adapt to shifts in the political climate. This course will confront such changes and examine how parties?as organizations, in government, and in the electorate?serve to shape politics in the United States.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

The course considers three primary questions. First, how can we understand why different states do different things and choose different policies? Why does New York spend more on education than Mississippi? Second, state governments are organized in different ways, so how can we understand why they made different organizational choices and what effects those choices have? Why did some states choose term limits for their legislators, and what effects did they have? Finally, how can we use the laboratory of the states to examine other important questions for American democracy?

Citizens in democracies are socialized to believe that certain ideals are upheld when political choices are made. These ideals range from voters making informed, issue-oriented decisions, to elected politicians enacting policies in pursuit of national interests, to government officials implementing those policies, to maximize the public good. Politics in practice, however, conflicts with these ideals. In general, political outcomes are the results of decisions by strategic, goal-oriented actors who promote their interests by choosing the best responses to the expected behavior of other strategic, goal-oriented actors. When these actors have competing interests, institutions and uncertainty shape political outcomes as much as the political decision-makers? preferences over the set of possible outcomes.

A large body of academic research explains the occurrence and dynamics of these violent processes, offering insights into the reasons why organized belligerent groups confront one another with violence. However, much of the violence associated with these political conflicts is aimed directly at innocent civilians who are otherwise uninvolved in formal conflict processes. Indeed, the exploits of some extraordinarily violent groups cause one to wonder if war has become more brutal and inhumane over time, as noncombatants suffer at the hands of armed actors. In fact, in many cases the savagery associated with violence against civilians may cause observers to believe that the violence has no logic or rationale at all. Is this violence senseless? Does it have no strategic motivation? If not entirely senseless, then how might we understand such brutal behaviors as mass rape, child soldiering, physical mutilation, and the killing of innocents in the context of war?

What effects will globalization and climate change have on the international political system? Will climate change eventually lead to land disputes and food shortages that increase the likelihood of conflict or will it force countries to work together to address its effects? Will globalization continue unabated, bringing citizens closer together and thereby reducing nationalism and interstate conflict, or will it heighten the likelihood of conflict by exacerbating wealth differences? Similar questions can be asked about the future of the European Union, the long-run prospects for peace in the Middle East, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the impact of artificial intelligence on international relations. This course seeks to answer questions like these by placing the student in the position of policy-makers who must rely on forecasting and the analysis of long-run trends in international politics. The course will explore how long-run changes in technology, demographics, economic integration, resource scarcity, climate, and democratization could alter the nature of international relations. Students will consider competing theories about the effects of these factors on international politics and explore what their arguments imply about the cumulative effects of these factors over several decades if expected trends hold.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Occasionally"

Key study areas will be: the diverse Mayan regions of Central America; the Andes, in both Inca-influenced and non-Incan indigenous spheres; and the colonial Southwest, called \u201cLa Gran Cjhichimeca\u201d in the colonial period, and home to traditions of sacred and secular theatre of Hopi, Dine, and Northern Mexico\u2019s Nahua-speaking peoples. From the 16th-century \u201cdances of the Conquest\u201d staged by Andean peoples with the help of renegade Spaniards, to contemporary production of Mayan and Southwestern pre-Conquest drama, re-staged and re-tooled to reflect current political concerns, we will study how the comp-lex nature of Latin American drama reflects itself in the use and innovation of these ancient forms of living Native American theatre. Influences both on and from Spanish Golden Age drama will also illuminate aspects of the reception of New World culture in Renaissance-era Europe, including the internal dissent regarding Empire within Spanish colonial opinion.Credits: 3Grading Graded (GRD)Typically Offered: Spring"

Along with the historical aspect, we examine the cultural and population mix that also emerges in these contexts, language use in various areas of society (education, administration, rituals, everyday life, entertainment, etc.) and the social structure reflected by their usage. Finally, we explore language attitudes and policies which directly correlate with the history of these languages.

This will lead us to reject the overly simplistic term Spanglish and will instead lead us to explore the potential development of new dialects of Spanish in four macro-regions of the U.S.: (1.) California, South Texas, and the Southwest; (2.) South Florida; (3.) the Northeast Megalopolis, and (4.) Chicago and the Midwest. To do so, we will examine the historical development of Spanish in each region and the linguistic-structural features that characterize it. We will also consider issues of bilingual language acquisition, the role of language contact in language change, and the role of dialect contact in new dialect formation, among other issues of language contact, variation, and change.

What are the current aesthetic and ideological forces that exert pressure on the contemporary theatre? To what extent has digital technology and media transformed the historical relations among theatre artists, performers, and audiences? How have social media tools affected these relations and how can theatre and performance respond? The course begins with the fundamental principles of dramaturgy including extensive dramatic literature analysis and its application in all aspects of theatre and performance production. From this foundation, we then consider the ways in which new forms of dramaturgy affect new forms of production, including not only theatre but also dance and multiple forms of performance art (with a particular emphasis on body art). Much of the course will use social media tools to communicate and collaborate, although familiarity with these is not a pre-requisite for the course.
